GREEDY(c, p, w, n)

sort the p in non-ascending order and rearrange w accordingly 
so price index alligns with weight index

let currentWeight = 0
let w = 0

while currentWeight <= c AND w < n
    if newWeights[w] <= (c - currentWeight)
        currentWeight = currentWeight + newWeights[w]
        maxValue = maxValue + p[w]
    w++
